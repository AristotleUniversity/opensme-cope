##The Component Adaptation Environment (COPE)##


###Welcome###

COPE is a tool that can be used for the analysis of software systems. It can provide an overview of the complexity of the system with design complexity metrics. It can also recommend clusters of classes suitable for extraction as independent software components. These clusters can be examined and extracted as Ant-based projects that the programmers can import in an IDE for further processing.

- For more information on COPE please refer to COPE User Guide. 
- For publications related to COPE have a look at the publications page.
- If you want to contribute to COPE's development please consult COPE Developers' starting instructions.
